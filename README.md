# Little_Tail_Story_Logo_Vector_&_Fan-Made_English_Version
The image files contained within this repository are vector images I made of the logo from Little Tail Story, a Japan-exclusive mobile game that is now offline. 
The aforementioned game was published by Bandai Namco, developed by CyberConnect2, and is part of the larger Little Tail Bronx world/lore. 
I have also took it upon myself to create an English version of the logo while trying to retain elements of the original Katakana logo. 
I also created parts of the banner that were covered by the logo and made it available as separate options.
For this project, I also provided an Adobe Illustrator file that shows my creative process behind the building of the vectors.
